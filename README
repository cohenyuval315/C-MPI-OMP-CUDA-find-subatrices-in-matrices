using MPI , omp, and cuda

MPI:
    master give each worker an image to process
    when worker finishs he ask master for another image,
    until no more images,

OMP:
    each worker uses omp to parrall the searching of the sub matrices in the image matrix given

CUDA:
    each submatrix search in matrix is parrall using cuda
